0.104 [2011-09-22]
 - (Addition) Some error handling stuff.
 - (Addition) Support <track> element.
 - (Update) Catch up to revision d81fcb920a1a3c351149cd66a64bf1b8ae14a172
   (2011-08-21) upstream.

0.103 [2011-02-09]
 - (Documentation Update) Copyright 2011.
 - (Bugfix) TagSoupParser.pm called a method that is renamed between this
   distribution and upstream using its upstream name.

0.102 [2011-01-19]
 - (Update) Catch up to revision f2c921a886ab0b3dfb8d21b82525e98a4a921ad4
   (2010-10-11) upstream.
 - (Addition) Support <summary> element.
 - (Addition) Support <figcaption> element.
 - (Addition) Allow <object> element to appear in <head> if document has an
   HTML4 doctype. This is a willful violation of the HTML5 parsing
   algorithm. (The <object> may have <param> elements as children, as well
   as any children that would normally be allowed in the <head> of the
   document, such as <meta>; any other content is treated as the beginning
   of the <body>, and thus closes <object> and <head>. That's slightly
   looser than the HTML 4 spec which says only <param> should be used, but
   stricter than the HTML 4 DTD which allows pretty much anything in
   there!)
 - (Bugfix) Fix source_line method.

0.101 [2010-06-30]
 - (Bugfix) UTF-8 fix.

0.100 [2010-06-23]
 - (Bugfix) Minor bugfixes.

0.04 [2010-04-21]
 - (Update) Catch up to revision cf2c0df8a6dfb50fee923dfb21b14c83f282ccdc
   (2010-02-28) upstream.

0.03 [2010-01-15]
 - (Packaging Update) Upgrade distribution to my new packaging regime
   (auto-generated changelogs, etc)
 - (Bugfix) Module didn't use URI::file properly.
 - (Documentation Update) Copyright 2010.

0.02 [2009-12-16]
 - Replace Inline::Python encoding detection with weaker, but native Perl
   HTML::Encoding package.
 - (Addition Packaging) Bundle the html2xhtml tool.
